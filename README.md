# Sign-Language-Glove

Welcome to the **Sign-Language-Glove** project! This innovative hardware-based solution translates American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into text or speech in real-time. Leveraging the power of Arduino Uno, flex sensors, and ADXL335 accelerometers, the Sign-Language Glove aims to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and hearing communities.

# Installation

### Hardware Setup

- Attach the flex sensors to each finger of the glove.
- Connect the ADXL335 accelerometer to the Arduino Uno.
- Pair the Arduino Uno with a Bluetooth module.
- Upload the firmware to the Arduino Uno using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

### Software Setup

- Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Slygriyrsk/sign-language-glove.git

- Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash 
   cd sign-language-glove

- Install the required dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run the gesture recognition script
```bash
   python gesture_recognition.py
```

# Bluetooth App Designing
The mobile application provides an interface for users to interact with the device, including features for converting sign language to audio or video signs.


### Connect Bluetooth
Establish a connection between your phone and the glove by selecting the appropriate Bluetooth address.

# Usage
- Wear the glove and ensure all sensors are securely attached.
- Turn on the Arduino Uno and pair it with your mobile device or computer via Bluetooth.
- Open the mobile or desktop app.
- Perform ASL gestures; the corresponding text and speech output will be displayed and played in real-time.
